# CLCL-tool_clip

### What is this?
tool_clip is not a standalone program but an extension to Mr. Tomoaki's great [CLCL clipboard tool](https://nakka.com/soft/clcl/index_eng.html) (sourcecode: https://github.com/nakkag/CLCL).
Currently it contains the following features for clipboard items:
- export items and template folders to json files
- import text items and merge template folders from json files 
- replace tabstops and/or sequences of spaces by a character string of choice
- convert tab separated data into an html table snippet, ready for example to insert into an email.
- save CLCL templates to and load from an ODBC database 

To be continued ...
