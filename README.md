# CLCL-tool_clip

### What is this?
tool_clip is not a standalone program but an extension to Mr. Tomoaki's great CLCL clipboard tool.
Currently it contains the following features for clipboard items:
- replace tabstops and/or sequences of spaces by a character string of choice
- convert tab separated data into an html table snippet, ready for example to insert into an email.
- save CLCL templates to and load from an ODBC database
